## Introduction

BitFun is an Agentic OS—and a companion right beside you.

It will interact through phones, watches, desktop robots, and more. It is part of your everyday life, and it evolves with you.

## Remote Control

Pair by scanning a QR code, and your phone instantly becomes a remote command center for the desktop Agent. Send one message, and the AI on the desktop starts working right away.

Besides the mobile browser scan, BitFun also supports Telegram / Feishu bots / WeChat bots for remote commands, with real-time visibility into Agent progress.

---

## Dual Modes

BitFun offers two modes for different scenarios:

- **Assistant Mode**: warm, remembers your preferences, with long-term memory. Best for ongoing collaboration—maintaining a project, continuing your aesthetic and working habits.
- **Professional Mode**: saves tokens, execution-first, clean context. Best for immediate tasks—fixing a bug, tweaking a style.

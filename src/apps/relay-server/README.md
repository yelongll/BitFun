# BitFun Relay Server

WebSocket relay server for BitFun Remote Connect. It bridges desktop (WebSocket) and mobile (HTTP) clients while forwarding end-to-end encrypted payloads.

## Features

- Desktop connects via WebSocket, mobile via HTTP
- End-to-end encrypted passthrough (the server does not decrypt payloads)
- Correlation-based HTTP-to-WebSocket request-response matching
- Per-room mobile-web static file upload and serving
- Heartbeat-based connection management with configurable room TTL
- Docker deployment support with optional Caddy reverse proxy

## Quick Start

### Recommended: Run on the target server

```bash
# Clone on the target server
git clone https://github.com/GCWing/BitFun
cd BitFun/src/apps/relay-server

# Deploy to the current machine
bash deploy.sh
```

`deploy.sh` must run on the target server itself. It deploys to the current machine only and does not SSH to another host.

### Service Operations

Run these commands on the target server inside this directory:

```bash
bash start.sh
bash stop.sh
bash restart.sh
docker compose ps
docker compose logs -f relay-server
```

Notes:

- `start.sh` is idempotent and exits if the service is already running.
- `stop.sh` exits cleanly when the service is already stopped.
- `restart.sh` restarts the service when running, or starts it when stopped.
- The container uses `restart: unless-stopped`.

### What URL should I fill in BitFun Desktop?

In **Remote Connect → Self-Hosted → Server URL**, use one of:

- `http://<YOUR_SERVER_IP>:9700`

`/relay` is only needed when your reverse proxy is configured with that path prefix.

### Manual Run

```bash
# From project root
cargo build --release -p bitfun-relay-server

# Run
RELAY_PORT=9700 ./target/release/bitfun-relay-server
```

## Deployment Checklist

1. Open required ports:
   - `9700` for direct relay access
   - `80/443` when using Caddy or another reverse proxy
2. Verify the health endpoint:
   - `http://<server-ip>:9700/health`
3. Decide the final URL strategy:
   - direct port or reverse proxy domain
4. Fill the same URL into BitFun Desktop custom server settings

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `RELAY_PORT` | `9700` | Server listen port |
| `RELAY_STATIC_DIR` | `./static` | Path to mobile web static files (fallback SPA) |
| `RELAY_ROOM_WEB_DIR` | `/tmp/bitfun-room-web` | Directory for per-room uploaded mobile-web files |
| `RELAY_ROOM_TTL` | `3600` | Room TTL in seconds (0 = no expiry) |

## API Endpoints

### Health & Info

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/health` | GET | Health check (returns status, version, uptime, room and connection counts) |
| `/api/info` | GET | Server info (name, version, protocol version) |

### Room Operations (Mobile HTTP → Desktop WS bridge)

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/rooms/:room_id/pair` | POST | Mobile initiates pairing; relay forwards to desktop via WebSocket and waits for a response |
| `/api/rooms/:room_id/command` | POST | Mobile sends an encrypted command; relay forwards it to desktop and returns the response |

### Per-Room Mobile-Web File Management

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/rooms/:room_id/upload-web` | POST | Full upload of base64-encoded files keyed by path (10 MB body limit) |
| `/api/rooms/:room_id/check-web-files` | POST | Incremental check for already uploaded files by hash |
| `/api/rooms/:room_id/upload-web-files` | POST | Incremental upload of only missing files (10 MB body limit) |
| `/r/:room_id/*path` | GET | Serve uploaded mobile-web static files for a room |

### WebSocket

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/ws` | WebSocket | Desktop client connection endpoint |

## WebSocket Protocol (Desktop Only)

Only desktop clients connect via WebSocket. Mobile clients use the HTTP endpoints above.

### Desktop → Server (Inbound)

```json
// Create a room
{ "type": "create_room", "room_id": "optional-id", "device_id": "...", "device_type": "desktop", "public_key": "base64..." }

// Respond to a bridged HTTP request (pair or command)
{ "type": "relay_response", "correlation_id": "...", "encrypted_data": "base64...", "nonce": "base64..." }

// Heartbeat
{ "type": "heartbeat" }
```

### Server → Desktop (Outbound)

```json
// Room created confirmation
{ "type": "room_created", "room_id": "..." }

// Pair request forwarded from mobile HTTP
{ "type": "pair_request", "correlation_id": "...", "public_key": "base64...", "device_id": "...", "device_name": "..." }

// Encrypted command forwarded from mobile HTTP
{ "type": "command", "correlation_id": "...", "encrypted_data": "base64...", "nonce": "base64..." }

// Heartbeat acknowledgment
{ "type": "heartbeat_ack" }

// Error
{ "type": "error", "message": "..." }
```

## Architecture

```
Mobile Phone ──HTTP POST──► Relay Server ◄──WebSocket── Desktop Client
                               │
                          E2E Encrypted
                          (server cannot
                           read messages)
```

The relay server bridges HTTP and WebSocket:

- **Desktop** connects via WebSocket, creates a room, and stays connected.
- **Mobile** sends HTTP POST requests such as `/pair` and `/command`.
- The relay forwards requests to the desktop over WebSocket with correlation IDs, waits for the response, and returns it over HTTP.
- The relay only manages rooms and forwards opaque encrypted payloads.
- Per-room mobile-web static files can be uploaded and served at `/r/:room_id/`.

## About `src/apps/server` vs `src/apps/relay-server`

- Remote Connect self-hosted deployment uses the relay server in this directory.
- `src/apps/server` is a different application and is not the relay service used by mobile and desktop Remote Connect.
